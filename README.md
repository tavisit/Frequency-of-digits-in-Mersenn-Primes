# What is it?

This code is necessary for the demonstration of the paper "Mersenne Primes 
and their uniform natural distribution of digits" by Matei Octavian Mihai, BEng TUCN, 2020, paper provided in the repository, with the objective to find the frequency of digits in Mersenne primes. The repository proves that the code was created by me, Matei Octavian Mihai, 
with the objective to parse a list of powers from the Marsenne primes, parse each prime and output the frequency of each digit. 


# What it contains?

It contains 
* a simple C Codeblocks project
* a List.txt file which contains the powers of 2 from the numbers which are prime
* an OutputFile.txt file which contains the power of 2, the digits and their frequency formated such that it is simple to export in a Excel spreadsheet
* in the Resources directory, there are the Mersenne numbers in a .txt file with the name "M%power_of_the_number%.txt", where %a% means that a is a variable which is replaced by an actual power of 2

# How to make it work?

Simply run the .exe from the /bin or run from an IDE
